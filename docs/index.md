## About This Project

**semantic_ops** demonstrates how PBIP (Power BI Projects) enables:

- ✅ **AI-Assisted Development** - Build tools by describing what you need
- ✅ **Version Control** - Git workflows for semantic models and reports  
- ✅ **Automated Quality Checks** - CI/CD pipelines with Best Practice Analyzer
- ✅ **Code Reviews** - Meaningful diffs and pull requests
- ✅ **Team Collaboration** - Text-based models enable real development workflows

This wasn't possible with binary `.pbix` files. PBIP changes everything.

## Why This Matters

Power BI is moving to PBIP as the default format (January 2026). Your semantic models become text files—readable by AI, versionable in Git, automatable in CI/CD.

The tools and workflows here show what's now possible when your Power BI metadata is accessible.
