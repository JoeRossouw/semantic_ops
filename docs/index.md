## What You'll Find

**Practical automation** - Python scripts that solve real problems in Power BI development workflows.

**AI-assisted development** - Learn to build tools by describing what you need instead of grinding through code.

**Real examples** - Working code, actual use cases, lessons learned building automation in production.

**Share and improve**. All tools are open source. Use them, fork them, make them better.

This is about making Power BI development more efficient, more collaborative, and honestly, more fun. Text-based semantic models opened the door. Now we're exploring what's possible.
