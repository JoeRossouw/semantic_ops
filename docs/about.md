# About

![Joe Rossouw](../assets/images/joe-rossouw.jpg){ align=right width=200 }

I'm Joe Rossouw, based in Dublin leading BI work around enterprise analytics, metadata management, and building CI/CD automation for Power BI.

## What I Do

I lead a talented team of BI developers pushing boundaries and innovating whenever we get a chance. My focus is making enterprise analytics work in production—CI/CD pipelines for Power BI, automated quality checks, metadata monitoring, and development frameworks that actually improve how teams work.

The shift to text-based semantic models (PBIP format) opened up new possibilities. I've built custom CI/CD frameworks using Azure DevOps, implemented metadata monitoring across Databricks and Log Analytics, and developed automation that makes Power BI development more like software engineering.

## Background

I've spent over 10 years building systems and managing data for public health programs. Did a master's in epidemiology and biostatistics, worked on large-scale program management, and started using Power BI in 2018 for healthcare monitoring and quality improvement. Fell in love with what you could build.

Came to Dublin a few years ago, consulted for a bit, and now manage a BI portfolio at enterprise scale—20+ data products, 60+ reports, and a community of practice supporting developers across the organization.

## This Site

This documentation site collects the automation tools and approaches I've developed working with Power BI at scale. Everything here is open source and built from real problems encountered in production.

I write about AI-assisted development—the practical side of using AI to build automation faster. The Prompts section shows exactly how I work with AI tools to go from problem to working code.
