Create an interactive HTML with:\n   - Dropdown to select any semantic model found (alphabetically sorted)\n   - Network graph visualization using vis.js showing tables as nodes and relationships as edges\n   - Color coding: Red boxes for fact tables (many-side), cyan circles for dimension tables (one-side)\n   - Click any table to highlight only its direct relationships (grey out unrelated tables/edges)\n   - Click empty space to reset highlighting\n   - Stats panel showing: total tables, relationships, fact tables, dimension tables\n   - Horizontal compact legend showing: fact/dimension colors, one-way/bidirectional/inactive line styles\n   - Info panel (right side) showing relationship details when table is clicked\n   - Table filter panel (left side) with checkboxes to show/hide tables dynamically\n   - Filter panel should have Select All/Deselect All buttons and proper z-index above canvas\n   - When highlighting relationships, only consider currently visible (filtered) tables\n   - Fast physics-based auto-layout (100 iterations max)\n4.
